# Description
Volumetric Lines is a fast, GPU-based volumetric line renderer based on a technique by SÃ©bastien Hillaire. It can be used to render lines with a volumetric appearance by smartly utilizing a texture. Through the use of different textures, different volumetric line effects can be achieved.

*Some usage examples:*      
Example 1: A radial gradient texture can be used to render anti-aliased volumetric lines like laser shots or light sabers.      
Example 2: A texture with a filled, solid circle positioned in the center of the square texture can be used to create the appearance of pipes.        

Technically, the algorithm only uses as little as 8 vertices to describe a single line and positions them smartly on the screen to create a volumetric appearance. It also includes an algorithm to render volumetric line strips.

# Support for the Universal Render Pipeline

Support for the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) has been added and is available on the branch [`universal_render_pipeline`](https://github.com/johannesugb/VolumetricLinesUnity/tree/universal_render_pipeline).
